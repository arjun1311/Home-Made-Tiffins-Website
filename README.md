# Home-Made-Tiffins(HMT) Web App.
#We have built an Online Tiffin Services called "Home Made Tiffins" for the Students of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.
The Idea was to Provide Home made tiffins to those Students who lives in the Hostels but do not eat their Meals in the Hostel's Mess instead eat outside the Campus by spending lots of money.
We were providing them Home made meals at very low cost as compared to Outside the university by just Charging minimal delivery fees only.

We were the team of four people , I have developed Frontend of the Website using Bootstrap4, HTML,CSS & Javascript. My other teammate made the back end of the website using PHP and SQL database for database management.
& the other two did User Research, validates the idea and market the product.
